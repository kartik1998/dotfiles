* **Directions for faster keyboard**: [link](https://vimforvscode.com/enable-key-repeat-vim)

Going through the keybindings and settings json should be enough but adding some info here:

**leader** is `<spacebar>`

* `<leader> [` previous editor
* `<leader> ]` next editor
* `<leader> v` split editor
* `<leader> e` toggle sidebar visibility

* Toggle terminal: `cmd w`

* Ensure that your keyboard settings are at fast (system preferences)
